            <p>
                My primary goal for this academic year is to build a solid foundation in full-stack web development. 
                By the end of the CISC3003 course, I intend to master HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and understand 
                how to deploy dynamic websites.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills by tackling complex algorithms and 
                participating in coding challenges. I hope to become a developer who can not only write code 
                but also design efficient and user-friendly solutions.

        <h2>My Reflection and Future Directions</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                Reflecting on my journey so far, I realized that while my technical skills are growing, 
                I need to work on my communication skills. As an introverted person, I sometimes find it 
                challenging to express my ideas in groups.
                <br><br>
                In the future, I plan to participate in more team-based projects to force myself out of 
                my comfort zone. I believe that being a great engineer requires not just technical prowess 
                but also the ability to collaborate effectively with others.
