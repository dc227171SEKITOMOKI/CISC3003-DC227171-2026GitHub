        <h2>My Values and Beliefs</h2>
        <p>
            I believe that honesty and responsibility are the most important values in both study 
            and life. As a computer science student, I think it is important to write clean and 
            reliable code and to be responsible for the work I produce.
            <br><br>
            I also value continuous learning. Technology changes very fast, so I believe that 
            maintaining curiosity and a willingness to learn new things is essential. 
            In addition, I respect teamwork and communication, even though I am an introverted person.

                    In the future, I hope to work in the technology industry, especially as a software 
                    engineer or developer. One of my dream companies is Bilibili.
                    <br><br>
                    I like Bilibili because it is not only a video platform, but also a creative community 
                    where people share knowledge, culture, and interests. I enjoy watching technology-related 
                    videos and educational content on Bilibili, which has inspired me to learn more about 
                    programming and computer science.

            <p>
                This website is my first personal web project using HTML and CSS. 
                During the development process, I learned how to structure a webpage 
                and apply basic styles to improve its appearance.

                As a computer science student, balancing study and personal life is very important.
                I try to manage my time well so that I can focus on my studies while also enjoying 
                my hobbies and daily life.
