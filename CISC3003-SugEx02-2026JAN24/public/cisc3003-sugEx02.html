<!-- ================= ABOUT ME ================= -->
<section id="about" class="section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
            I am a undergreduate student at the University of Macau, majoring in Computer Science. 
    I come from Japan and I chose to study in Macau because I wanted to experience 
    a different culture and educational environment. I am a relatively introverted 
    person, but I enjoy focusing deeply on things that interest me.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I am learning programming and web development, including HTML and CSS. 
    Although I am still a beginner, I find it very interesting to create things by myself 
    and see them displayed on the screen. I hope to continue improving my technical skills 
    step by step.
    </p>

<!-- ================= VALUES ================= -->
<section id="values" class="section blue">
    <h2>My Values and Beliefs</h2>

    <p>
        I believe that honesty and responsibility are the most important values in both study 
    and life. As a computer science student, I think it is important to write clean and 
    reliable code and to be responsible for the work I produce.
    <br><br>
    I also value continuous learning. Technology changes very fast, so I believe that 
    maintaining curiosity and a willingness to learn new things is essential. 
    In addition, I respect teamwork and communication, even though I am an introverted person.

            <p>
                 In the future, I hope to work in the technology industry, especially as a software 
			    engineer or developer. One of my dream companies is Bilibili.
			    <br><br>
			    I like Bilibili because it is not only a video platform, but also a creative community 
			    where people share knowledge, culture, and interests. I enjoy watching technology-related 
			    videos and educational content on Bilibili, which has inspired me to learn more about 
			    programming and computer science.
			    <br><br>
			    My goal is to improve my programming skills, gain practical experience, and eventually 
			    contribute to building meaningful and user-friendly products in the future.

            This website is my first personal web project using HTML and CSS. 
    		During the development process, I learned how to structure a webpage 
    		and apply basic styles to improve its appearance.
    		<br><br>
    		Although I encountered some difficulties at the beginning, such as layout 
    		and CSS issues, solving these problems gave me a strong sense of achievement.

    		I try to manage my time well so that I can focus on my studies while also enjoying 
    		my hobbies and daily life.
    		<br><br>
    		I believe that maintaining a healthy mindset will help me grow both academically
